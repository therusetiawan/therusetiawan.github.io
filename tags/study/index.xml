      <description>Becoming a master&amp;rsquo;s student at Gadjah Mada University was a surprise, especially considering that I obtained this status with a scholarship. You can read this post to know about how I secured the scholarship from the DIY province.
On July 30, 2023 BKD DIY released &amp;ldquo;Surat Keputusan Tugas Belajar&amp;rdquo; for all scholarship awardees. &amp;ldquo;Tugas Belajar&amp;rdquo; means that, as civil servants, we will be excused from all duties to focus on our studies.</description>

      <description>March 1, 2019, i have been appointed as a civil servant candidate (CPNS) in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY) province, assigned to work as a vocational teacher at Seyegan Vocational High School. I admit that this achievement is not well planned, as I thoroughly enjoyed working as a software engineer. In 2018, my second year at an international startup, I briefly wrote about it in this post. In the same post, I mentioned a plan to pursue a master degree but at that time i had no exact plan.</description>
